Observation„É¢„Éº„Éâ

When the network has passed Observation mode. No date set for that, yet.

Should happen rather quickly. But some time will be needed for observation, to make sure everything is running as intended

Flare mainnet was launched in July. Observation Mode was said to be at least 8 weeks and there was no set date for the FLR token distribution event.

No, distribution won‚Äôt start today. Could be this month or next. We will give the community some advanced notice.

Not until they run a Validator node. The software hasn‚Äôt been released by Flare, so we can‚Äôt yet.

No, it‚Äôs not ended. Validation needs to controlled (67+%) by the data providers, that hasn‚Äôt happened yet.

They haven't released the software for us to run the nodes, yet. We're hoping for that to happen in the near future. The network itself, is performing well.

Because you‚Äôll need to wrap your FLR in order to receive monthly airdrop tokens and to delegate

There will be a Flare app for Ledger. Once you receive your initial 15% you can interface with Metamask and transfer your FLR to any flare supported wallet of your choice‚Ä¶.then wrap your FLR in the new wallet to receive the monthly airdrop rewards

One would need to hold wFLR to qualify for the monthly airdrop distributions, yes. The 85% is a shared rewards pool, not a specific participant‚Äôs amount. The more one engages with the network, the more rewards they will receive 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2118539/188473670-27c3bc66-02e0-4ba5-af95-2f6f6c4daf2b.png)

The airdrop smart contracts take multiple snapshots of the wFLR balances each month to distribute rewards to wFLR holders accordingly

15% initial airdrop applies to those who held  XRP on 12/12/2020 and will need to be wrapped on the Flare network to qualify for the monthly allotments if the proposal passes. Newly acquired FLR also qualifies for the monthly airdrop distribution as long as their are wrapped as well

Use the same process for WFLR, go to the Flare explorer and search WNat ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the wrapped token address.

I suggest you level up on the overall ecosytem because terms like "wrapping" are basic requirements. That's if you plan on participating, if not then all good. üëçWe've got a "Getting Started" guide you might find useful, it's as basic as it gets.
